This application developed by Databaes, a Group of Students at the University of Arizona, for their Master's level course (MIS 531).  
The Project scope was to help a local non-profit organization, Tucson Clean and Beautiful, in developing a project tracking
and management application.  The following code is a proof of concept of the Database Design.  

The application covers most of the ER diagram, however due to the short project timeline, a few parts were left out.

All rights are reserved by Databaes, however the application is free to use by any party... Happy Coding!
